Introduction:
Credit risk refers to the possibility of loss that a lender or investor may face due to the failure of a borrower to repay a loan or fulfill other financial obligations. It is the risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower's inability or unwillingness to pay back the money borrowed.

Credit risk is a major concern for banks, financial institutions, and investors who lend money or invest in securities, as it can lead to a reduction in the value of their investments or even to a loss of principal. To manage credit risk, lenders and investors often use credit scoring models, perform due diligence on borrowers, and set credit limits and collateral requirements.

Machine Learning models have been helping these companies to improve the accuracy of their credit risk analysis, providing a scientific method to identify potential debtors in advance.
